Honest Reflection on AI Use

1.

Being a rookie coder in Zone01 kind of pushes you to get the answer quickly so you can get the XP. On our first day, I remember people saying “use AI to learn from it” and also “don’t get the answers without understanding the problem deeply.” I did both. I used AI for learning, and I also used it to give me the answers so I could get the solution and move on. When I stopped worrying about being behind, I changed the way I used AI. From that moment, I used it only for learning and for explaining the problem deeply.

It depends on the difficulty of the problem and the time I have to solve/deliver it. At first, AI was a no-brainer for me, but now I want to try the problem on my own first, and then use AI. If I have more time, I would definitely try more without using it.

Yes — some parts, but not the whole code. There are parts that I understand and i am able to explain. However, I believe we should be able to explain 80–90% of our code, not just small parts of it.

Again, it depends on the difficulty of the test/exam. If it’s close to my current technical skills, I will figure it out, but if it’s not, it will be hard for me.

Right now, I’m trying to become Learner B. I try to use AI as a learning amplifier, and I don’t like using it to give me the answers.

Today, I’m at the beginning of my coding journey. I’ve learned that overusing AI doesn’t help me at all. Growth, learning, and understanding come from my own practice and effort. Ideally, AI should play the role of a teacher. By using it, I want to be able to learn everything by studying effectively
